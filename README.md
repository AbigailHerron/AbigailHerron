- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbigailHerron
-    I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Sligo IT, hoping to learn more about coding in general.
          So far, I've had a basic introduction to Java, C# and some JS but I hope to exand on this as I get better.
- 🌱 The focus of my studies is heavily on the database and networking side so I don't think I'll be posting any groundbreaking software advancements, but
          feel free to have a nosey anyway.
- 🖥️ I'm hoping to get into something like Database / Network Administration, but my work goals aren't set in stone. Every career path I look at seems to 
          require a varied skillset, so I'm open to other possibilities too.
